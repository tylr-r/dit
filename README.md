# Dit

Morse code practice. Tap for dot, hold for dah.

## Principles

- One thing per mode
- Instant feedback
- Works on phone or keyboard
- Reference chart built in
- Tracks what you know (and what you don't)

## Modes

**Practice** — Match the prompted letter. Get it right, move on. Get it wrong, start over.

**Freestyle** — Tap out whatever you want and see what letter it is. Word mode lets you spell things out.

**Listen** — Hear a letter, type the answer.

## TODO

- Add prosigns
- Word practice mode
- Conversation practice mode where you can chat with AI

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
